### Combination of movements and breath
Kundalini yoga is the yoga of consciousness. He was brought from India to the United States in 1969 by Yogi Bhajan, and his practice is multifaceted. It consists of a series of exercises which are a combination of body and hand postures (asana and mudras), chants (mantras), respiratory exercises (pranayama) and meditations. The set of exercises has a particular objective, which can be centered on a part of the body (back, kidneys, lungs, etc.), a system of the body (respiratory, digestive, endrocrine, etc.), or on aspect of the life (vitality, stress, elevation, depression, resistance to disease, etc.).

### Awakening your life energy force
Kundalini yoga takes its name from the kundalini, creative energy located at the base of the spine, where it is wound on itself like a loop (kundal means “the hair loop of the beloved”). The practice of kundalini yoga aims to awaken this dormant energy, to circulate it in the body and to learn to control it so that it nourishes it, heals it, balances it.

### Strength, clarity and balance
In general, the practice of kundalini yoga strengthens the nervous system, cleanses and clarifies the mind, strengthens the body, feels stronger to face the challenges of life, and builds a deep relationship with yourself. These benefits are even greater when we practice a series that initially “touched” us a lot, which revealed us to a part of us. Practicing it daily for a period makes it possible to go even more in contact with this truth in itself, on the way to its Higher Self, the unlimited Self.
