# At the european level

Whatever kundalini yoga class you go to, you will notice that the class structure is the same, and that we teach the same kriya (set of exercices). Each one in our own way, but with same instructions. What we teach are kriyas and meditations that were transmitted by Yogi Bhajan from 1969 to 2004.
