Kundalini yoga is the yoga of awareness. I tried this practice for the first time in 2016 and was captivated by it. I loved it because it was meditative (we generally practice with eyes closed), because it invited me to surpassing myself (with total listening of my bodyâ€™s specificities and limits), and because it included music and mantra chanting. At that time, yoga was the  only physical practice I could tackle after an injury while practicing martial arts.

### Certified kundalini yoga and meditation teacher
While deepening my practice, I felt calmer and stronger, and more and more connected to my true self. I trained to be a teacher in 2019 ([Ik Saran Dhian - School of Sacred Living, France](http://iksarandhian.com/)), and I regularly spend time in ashrams where I participate in the community life of those places, through selfless service. It is always a beautiful opportunity for me to meet other yogis, to learn about life experience as a human, about yogic teachings, and about yogic cooking (another of my passions, see my instagram account @santosha.cooking).

### What I want to share
The tools of kundalini yoga support my transformation and healing, and bring me closer to my potential, with joy and by calmly facing the challenges that come. I have trust  that they can also support your journey, whatever path you are walking on !

I am grateful for the teachers who brought me kundalini yoga tools. I am also really pleased, passionate, and honoured to be part of the chain of people who transmit these tools now.

In the spirit of service,

Seva Devprem
