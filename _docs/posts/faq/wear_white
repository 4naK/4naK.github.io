# White supports your magnetic field
White is said to support your magnetic field, to expand your aura.
Symbollically it is the color or purity, and it has also be chosen in many martial arts. As white clothes are easy to stain, when you were white, you also increase your awareness of yanything that you do (because you don't want to have stains at the end of the day !). This help you to develop grace, subtlety. 
It is like a yogic costume !
You don't have to were white to come to a class - just stay with the comfortable clothes that you already have! - but if you have some, try and see how you feel with it !
